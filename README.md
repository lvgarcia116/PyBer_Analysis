# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The overview of this project is to create a summary Dataframe using Python and Pandas of the ride-sharing data by city type then create a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Results
Accoring to the chart, rural cities had the least number of drivers where as urban cities had the highest number, same for the total number of rides. Despite rural cities having the least amount of drivers, rural cities have the highest average fare per driver. Yet urban cities have the highest number of drivers yet they make the least average fare per driver. This could be because fares are more expensive for those that travel from rural cities to urban cities due to the longer time/ milegae it takes to travel from rural cities to urban cities.

### Summary
Based on the results, in addressing the disparities among city types, the CEO of PyBer could increase prices of service based on demand (i.e., rush hour) to increase the average fare per driver in Urban cities. Additionally, for those in urban cities traveling less than a certain distance, the CEO to implement a set minimum so that urban drivers can expect a minimum amount. Lastly, based on the demand in rural cities, urban drivers can travel to rural cities and pick up passengers from rural and increase their average fare.
